HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
=================

UIP is in its very early development stage, you can go over the issues on the 
github issues page and send in a PR.

your commits in the PR should be of the form:

```
shortlog: commit message

commit body
Fixes <issue number>
```
before you push remember to run
```
coala
```
and commit all changes suggested

where short log is the area/filename where you make the change
commit message is the very brief description of the change made by you and any
other additional details go into the commit body.

Do remember to keep your master branch updated at all times
and always work on a different branch.

Happy coding :)
